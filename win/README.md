# CapsLock Enhancement Windows

## ANSI 60 Key and Keycap change

My external keyboard has a small ANSI 60 keys layout that is different from both my Mac and Windows laptop's UK ISO keyboards. It's reprogrammed with firmware to have the left modifier keys (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Win</kbd>/<kbd>Alt</kbd>) swapped to (<kbd>Ctrl_L</kbd>/<kbd>Alt</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl_R</kbd>) to allow the same finger positions for the same Hyper shortcuts defined in both MacOS and Windows.

## Hyper CapsLock Windows

The additional `Ctrl_R` key gives a close <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> experience when in Windows, While the original `Ctrl_L` key on the left makes Windows users feel at home by keeping Windows `Ctrl+` shortcuts unchanged.

Only the top `Hyper+` layer are kept for the middle `T/G/V/B` keys because they are difficult to reach for the `Hyper+Ctrl+` layer.
