## Hyper CapsLock Unified

> *Make CapsLock Consistently Great on MacOS and Windows!*

I'm an user switching between my work PC and my personal Mac for different coding projects. My goal is to create configurations so I can have almost identical experiences when on MacOS and Windows, with or without my small external ANSI 60 keyboard.

Based on [Vonng/Capslock](https://github.com/Vonng/Capslock), and some extra features are introduced:

* Consistent shortcut combinations between MacOS and Windows with different keyboard layouts.
* Duplicated key combos for a greater redundancy, less typo and ease of use.
* Removed hard to reach and less used key combinations for better ergonomics.
* Remapped the app launch keys accoding to their initials.
* Remapped frequent IDE functions to keys with close semantic meanings, such as <kbd>-</kbd> and <kbd>+</kbd> for `Fold` and `Unfold`.
* Remapped <kbd>#</kbd>, <kbd>Â£</kbd>, <kbd>`</kbd> and <kbd>~</kbd>, so they are typed in consistent fashions across keyboard and OS.
* Simplified to have only one extra modifier, the left <kbd>Cmd</kbd> key, when <kbd>Hyper</kbd> is used.
